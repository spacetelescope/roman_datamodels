Using Roman Datamodels
======================

The following illustrates common operations with the datamodels.
This is most relevant for interactive use with a loaded datamodel
or if one is writing scripts or programs to view and manipulate
these data models. Developing new datamodels is a different topic
and may be covered in the future. For the most part, it involves
defining what the schema for such a model must be and what modifications
are needed to the code to support it (usually not much).

The normal approach is to open the datamodel as follows (this assumes
the file displayed as the Level 1 example in the general structure
page::

    >>> import roman_datamodels as rdm
    >>> dm = rdm.open('my_wonderful_roman_data.asdf')

    >>> type(dm)
    roman_datamodels.datamodels.ScienceRawModel

    >>> print(dm.meta.instrument.optical_element)
    GRISM

    # most nodes have special types

    >>> type(dm.meta.exposure)
    roman_datamodels.stnode.Exposure

    >>> print(dm.data.shape)
    (6, 4096, 4096)

    >>> print(dm.data.dtype)
    uint16

    # Change metadata value

    >>> dm.meta.exposure.start_time_mjd = 60000.
    print(dm.meta.exposure.start_time_mjd)
    60000.0

    # Assign invalid type

    >>> d.meta.exposure.start_time_mjd = "hello"
    >>> d.validate()

    # Last part of resulting traceback

    ValidationError: While validating start_time_mjd the following error occurred:
    'hello' is not of type 'number'

    Failed validating 'type' in schema:
        {'$schema': 'http://stsci.edu/schemas/asdf-schema/0.1.0/asdf-schema',
         'archive_catalog': {'datatype': 'float',
                             'destination': ['ScienceCommon.exposure_start_time_mjd']},
         'description': 'This records the time at the start of the exposure '
                        'using the\n'

                        'archive catalog for\n'
                        'multi-mission matching.\n',

         'type': 'number'}

    On instance:
        'hello'

    # Note the extra information in the schema segment showing origin of
    # the information and the destination in the archive.

    # Try to assign wrong kind of node

    >>> dm.meta.exposure = dm.meta.observation
    >>> dm.validate()

         'visit_id': '?'}

    # Show and then change pixel value in data

    >>> dm.data[0, 10, 10]
    115
    >>> dm.data[0, 10, 10] = 42
    >>> dm.data[0, 10, 10]
    42

    # Save to a new file

    >>> dm.to_asdf('test.asdf')
    >>> dm2 = rdm.open('test.asdf')
    >>> dm2.data[0, 10, 10]
    42
    >>> dm2.meta.exposure_start_time_mjd
    60000.0


.. note::

    There are a couple subtleties with regard to changing values in a datamodel.
    If you assign dicts or lists to attributes, it will map these into the
    corresponding DNode or LNode subclasses. In such uses, the assigned values
    will be immediately checked by validating against the defining schemas.
    When the value being assigned fails to pass that validation, an exception
    will occur. This is generally a good thing, particularly if you are changing
    values interactively.

    If you are getting validation errors consult the corresponding schema in
    ``rad`` to see what is allowed. If you think the schema is wrong, or you
    continue to have issues, please contact the Roman team for help.

    As a method of last resort, if you wish to turn off validation, you can do
    so by setting the environment variable ``ROMAN_VALIDATE`` to false. This is
    not recommended! Moreover, this feature will be explicitly removed when the
    datamodels stabilize.

    .. code-block:: bash

        export ROMAN_VALIDATE=false

    To restore validation, set the environment variable to ``true`` or unset it.


.. warning::

    We strongly recommend against ever turning off validation. This can lead to
    a variety of unrecoverable problems. Such as not being able to write out
    your datamodel or not being able to read it back in. Or worse, the data in
    the datamodel may not be compatible with operations intended to run on that
    datamodel. The Roman team will not assist with fixing such problems which
    occur when validation is turned off.

    Use this feature at your own risk!

    If you are having problems due to validation errors, please contact the the
    Roman team for help via raising a GitHub issue. We will do our best to assist
    you.
