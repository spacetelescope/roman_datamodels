Stnode Functionality
====================

As seen throughout :ref:`using-datamodels`, "node" objects are used to actually
handle and store the data for a datamodel. Indeed, if one opens an ASDF file
with a roman datamodel directly with `asdf.open` instead of
`roman_datamodels.datamodels.open`, the resulting object stored under the
``roman`` attribute will be a specialized `~roman_datamodels.stnode.DNode` object rather
than a `~roman_datamodels.datamodels.DataModel` object. Thus the stnode, "node"
objects form the data storage and manipulation backbone of the roman datamodels.


Node Types
**********

There are two main container node types `~roman_datamodels.stnode.DNode` and
`~roman_datamodels.stnode.LNode` which correspond to "dictionary" and
"list"-like data structures, respectively.

Currently, these two objects are implemented so that they follow the
dictionary or list interface; meaning that, they can be accessed via the ``[]``
operator (``node["keyword"]`` or ``node[0]``). However, for the case of the
`~roman_datamodels.stnode.DNode` objects, keys can also be used to directly
access the data attributes of the object via the Python ``.`` operator
(``node.keyword``). This is so that the `~roman_datamodels.stnode.DNode`
objects "look" like they are nice Python derived types.


Dynamic Node Construction
*************************

A specialized "node" class, that is a node class with a specific name which maps
to a corresponding schema name, will be created and registered by
`~roman_datamodels.stnode` when the module is first imported. The schemas which
get this treatment are the "tagged" schemas defined within the ``datamodels-*``
manifest in the RAD package. Any "un-tagged" schemas in RAD will not have a
corresponding stnode object. Instead, the information they contain will be
stored in a `~roman_datamodels.stnode.DNode` or `~roman_datamodels.stnode.LNode`
object, depending on the schema in question.

The specific stnode objects will be subclasses of the
`~roman_datamodels.stnode.TaggedObjectNode` or
`~roman_datamodels.stnode.TaggedListNode` classes. These classes are extensions
of the `~roman_datamodels.stnode.DNode` and `~roman_datamodels.stnode.LNode`
classes which have extensions to handle looking up the schema information.
In particular, they will track the ``tag`` information
contained within the manifest from RAD.

These "tagged-nodes" are then turned into specific stnode objects via the
factories in `roman_datamodels.stnode._factories`. The way these factories work
is they process the ``tag`` value and strip out the unique name for the schema,
which gets turned into a name for the type that the factory will create.

.. note::

    If special methods are needed for a specific stnode object, then one needs
    to add class to `roman_datamodels.stnode._mixins` with the appropriate
    methods/properties under the name ``<expected-class-name>Mixin``. The
    factories will automatically pick up these mixins and mix them into the
    stnode object correctly when it is created.

These factories are looped over and invoked by the
`roman_datamodels.stnode._stnode` module which will be imported whenever
`roman_datamodels.stnode` is imported which will generate the stnode objects and
register them during that import. Note that this module is imported as part of
the `roman_datamodels.datamodels` module.


ASDF
----

The stnode objects are designed to be serializable to and from ASDF files. As
noted above, the stnode objects wrapped by the
`~roman_datamodels.datamodels.DataModel` are the actual objects which are
serialized to ASDF not the `~roman_datamodels.datamodels.DataModel` object
itself.

``roman_datamodels`` provides a custom ASDF extension so that ASDF can handle
the stnode objects. This extension does not include the schemas used to build
the stnode objects, as the schemas are already included in extension provided by
the RAD package. The ASDF extension itself is defined in the
`roman_datamodels.stnode._converters` module. As part of this module, the
serialization and de-serialization logic is defined in the "converters" for each
of the "tagged" object base classes. The extension is then integrated into
ASDF by the `roman_datamodels.stnode._integration` module, as this module allows
the ASDF extension to be registered with ASDF without having to always import
``roman_datamodels`` whether or not it is used for a particular case. This is
a recommendation from ASDF so that the extension will have minimal impact on the
general ASDF performance for a given user.
