Deprecate the use of ``stnode``'s public API in favor of making it private to RDM.
This limits the exposure of all the legacy support code that ``stnode`` has, which
can cause unintended side effects if used directly. Since the only tagged objects
in RDM are now the base nodes for the datamodels, there is no reason to expose them
publicly anymore to users as they can just call any of the public API for those nodes
on the datamodels directly.
